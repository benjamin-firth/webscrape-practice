# Mountain Toad Brewery Food Truck Web Scraper
This is my first attempt at making a webscraper. It will show the current days food truck in the console.

## Steps:
1. The scraper will go to the mountain toad website.
2. It will click on the food truck schedule tab.
3. It will then click on the current days food schedule.
4. It will identify the food truck's name for that day and log it in the console.

## Setup:
Clone down the repo, then make sure you have installed nightmare, nodemon, and run an npm install.
From there just run nodemon scrape.js in your terminal!
